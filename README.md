# PokemonEmeraldRemade

Still WIP
Basically a remade version of the original emerald version.
- Increase the size of the towns, routes maps
- Add new routes/location
- Modify a few location
- Scale the trainers/wild pokemon to your level
- Rematchable trainers in the gyms
- add a post game
- add a few items (ice cream/snacks functioning like a medicine) just for fun
- day and night encounters
- internal trade : you can evolve your pokemon without trading with someone else
- AI wants to knock you out instead of letting you win
- Try to stay as lore friendly as possible
- Only the 3 first gen
